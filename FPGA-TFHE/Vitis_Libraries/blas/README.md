# Vitis BLAS Library

Vitis BLAS Library is an open-sourced Vitis library written in C++ and released under
[Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
for accelerating linear algebra functions in a variety of use cases.

The main target audience of this library is users who want to accelerate
linear algebra functions with FPGA cards.
Currently, this library offers three levels of acceleration:

* At module level is for the C++ implementation of BLAS functions. These implementations are intended to be used by HLS (High Level Synthesis) users to build FPGA logic for their applications. 
* The kernel level is for pre-defined kernels that are the C++ implementation of BLAS functions. These implementations are intended to demonstrate how FPGA kernels are defined and how L1 primitive functions can be used by any Vitis users to build their kernels for their applications. 
* The software APIs level is an implementation of BLAS on top of the XILINX runtime (XRT). It allows software developers to use Vitis BLAS library without writing any runtime functions and hardware configurations.

## Requirements

### FPGA Accelerator Card

Modules and APIs in this library work with Alveo U280 or U250 or U200 or U50.

* [Alveo U280](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u280.html)
* [Alveo U50](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u50.html)
* [Alveo U250](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u250.html)
* [Alveo U200](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u200.html)

### Software Platform

Supported operating systems are RHEL/CentOS 7.4, 7.5 and Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS, 18.04.1 LTS.

_GCC 5.0 or above_ is required for C++11/C++14 support.
With CentOS/RHEL 7.4 and 7.5, C++11/C++14 should be enabled via
[devtoolset-6](https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/devtoolset-6/).

### Development Tools

This library is designed to work with Vitis 2021.2,
and a matching version of XRT should be installed.

## Running Test Cases

This library ships two types of case: HLS cases and Vitis cases.
HLS cases can only be found in `L1/tests` folder, and are created to test module-level functionality.

### Setup environment

Setup and build envrionment using the Vitis and XRT scripts:

```
    source <install path>/Vitis/2021.2/settings64.sh
    source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh
```

### HLS Cases Command Line Flow

```console
cd L1/tests/
python ./run_test.py --operator amax amin --csim
```

Test control variables are:

- `csim` for high level simulation.
- `csynth` for high level synthesis to RTL.
- `cosim` for co-simulation between software test bench and generated RTL.

### Vitis Cases Command Line Flow

#### L2

```console
cd L2/tests/vitis_case_folder

# build and run one of the following using U280 platform
make run TARGET=sw_emu DEVICE=/path/to/xilinx_u250_gen3x16_xdma_3_1_202020_1.xpfm

# delete generated files
make cleanall
```

#### L3

```console
cd L3/tests/vitis_case_folder

# build and run one of the following using U280 platform
make run TARGET=hw_emu DEVICE=/path/to/xilinx_u250_gen3x16_xdma_3_1_202020_1.xpfm

# delete generated files
make cleanall
```

Here, `TARGET` decides the FPGA binary type

- `sw_emu` is for software emulation
- `hw_emu` is for hardware emulation
- `hw` is for deployment on physical card. (Compilation to hardware binary often takes hours.)

Besides ``run``, the Vitis case makefile also allows ``host`` and ``xclbin`` as build target.
