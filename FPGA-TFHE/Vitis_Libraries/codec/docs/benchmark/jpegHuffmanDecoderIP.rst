============
JPEG Huffman Decoder
============

Jpeg Huffman Decoder example resides in ``L1/tests/jpegDec`` directory. The tutorial provides a step-by-step guide that covers commands for building and running IP.

Executable Usage
===============

* **Work Directory(Step 1)**

The steps for library download and environment setup can be found in :ref:`l1_vitis_codec`. For getting the design,

.. code-block:: bash

   cd L1/tests/jpegDec

* **Run and Build IP(Step 2)**

Run the following make command to build your IP targeting a specific device. Please be noticed that this process will take a long time, maybe couple of hours.

.. code-block:: bash

   make run DEVICE=xilinx_u50_gen3x16_xdma_201920_3 VIVADO_IMPL=1

   Usage: host.exe -[-xclbin -JPEGFile]
          -JPEGFile:  the path point to input *.jpg

Note: Default arguments are set in Makefile, you can use other :ref:`pictures` listed in the table.

* **Example output(Step 2)** 

.. code-block:: bash

Profiling
=========

The hardware resource utilizations are listed in the following table.
Different tool versions may result slightly different resource.

    | 1. MAX_DEC_PIX is for benchmark. If testcase image is larger than 20M, the value of MAX_DEC_PIX should be enlarged following the size of image.   
    | 2. MAXCMP_BC is for benchmark. If testcase image is larger than 20M, the value of MAXCMP_BC should be enlarged following the size of image.
