/**
 * @brief DecisionTree Node data struct in kernel, for both train and predict.
 *
 * As shown below in the struct, this data structure includes two elements, nodeInfo and threshold
 * nodeInfo matches width of uram, includes 4 detailed members:
 * 1.isLeaf (nodeInfo.range(0,0)) judges if current node is a leaf
 * for leaf node:
 * 2.leafCat (nodeInfo.range(15,1)) determines the final category id
 * for Non-leaf node
 * 3.featureId (nodeInfo.range(31,16)) determines the next featureId should be used to make decision
 * 4.chl (nodeInfo.range(71,32)) : left child id  in a Decision Tree node list
 *
 * regValue is corresponding to the value of a leaf node
 * threshold is corresponding to value of featureId in a sample
 * If value of featureId in a sample < threshold, go to left child , otherwise go to right child(chl+1)
