2021.2
------

The 2021.2 release provide CSV Parser:

* **CSV Parser** could parse comma-seperated value files and generate object stream which could easily be connected with DataFrame APIs.
  CSV is a common used storage format in Date Lake. CSV parser could be used to accelerate data extract process. 

2021.1
------

The 2021.1 release provide Two-Gram text analytics:

* Two Gram Predicate (TGP) is a search of the inverted index with a term of 2 characters. 
  For a dataset that established an inverted index, it can find the matching id in each record in the inverted index.


2020.2
------

The Data Analytics Library has the following addition in the 2020.2 release:

* **Text Processing APIs.** Two major APIs in this family has been included: the *regular expression match* and *geo-IP lookup*.
  The former API can be used to extract content from unstructured data like logs,
  while the later is often used in processing web logs, to annotate with geographic information by IP address.
  A demo tool that converts Apache HTTP server log in batch into JSON file is provided with the library.
* **DataFrame APIs.** DataFrame is widely popular in-memory data abstraction in data analytics domain,
  the DataFrame write and read APIs should enable data analytics kernel developers to store temporal data
  or interact with open-source software using `Apache Arrow`__ DataFrame more easily.
* **Tree Ensemble Method.** *Random forest* is extended to include regression.
  *Gradient boost tree*, based on boosting method, is added to support both classification and regression.
  Support for *XGBoost on classification and regression* is also included to exploit 2nd order derivative of loss function and regularization.
