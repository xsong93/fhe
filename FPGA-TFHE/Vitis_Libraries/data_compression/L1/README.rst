   :description: Vitis Data Compression library L1 module overview

==================
Primitive Overview
==================

The Algorithm library provides a range of primitives for implementing data compression in C++ for Vitis. Headers for these hardware APIs can be found in the ``include`` directory of the package.

Stream-based Interface
``````````````````````
The interface of primitives in this library are mostly HLS streams, with the main input stream along with output stream throughout the dataflow.

Within a HLS dataflow region, all primitives connected via HLS streams can work in parallel resulting in the FPGA acceleration.
