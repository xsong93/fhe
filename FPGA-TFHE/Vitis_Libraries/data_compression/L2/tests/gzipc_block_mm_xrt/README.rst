==============================
Xilinx GZip Compression [XRT]
==============================

GZip example resides in ``L2/tests/gzipc_block_mm_xrt`` directory. 
This application uses native XRT APIs for host programming.

Follow build instructions to generate host executable and binary.

The binary host file generated is named as "**xil_gzip**" and it is present in ``./build`` directory.

Executable Usage
----------------

1. To execute single file for compression 	          : ``./build/xil_gzip -xbin ./build/xclbin_<xsa_name>_<TARGET mode>/compress.xclbin -c <file_name>``
2. To execute multiple files for compression    : ``./build/xil_gzip -xbin ./build/xclbin_<xsa_name>_<TARGET mode>/compress.xclbin -cfl <files.list>``

	- ``<files.list>``: Contains various file names with current path

The usage of the generated executable is as follows:

.. code-block:: bash
 
   Usage: application.exe -[-h-c-l-xbin-B]
          --help,           -h      Print Help Options
          --xclbin,         -xbin   XCLBIN                                               Default: [compress]
          --compress,       -c      Compress
          --file_list,      -cfl    List of Input Files
