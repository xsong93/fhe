*************************************************
Internal Design of Renumber 
*************************************************


Overview
========
The renumbering recode the categorized graph's table and it supports 64M data for input. The output is a number from 0 to some value, the size of new graph can  
calculate based the value.

Implementation
==============
The implemention is shown in the figure below:

   :alt: renumber design
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

The kernel will do the following steps:

1. Set Uram: Load the original cids of the graph and scan vertices to set URAM. If vertex's cid is first appear, the flag on URAM will be writen trueï¼Œotherwise the flag will be writen false.

2. Lookup HBM: Lookup HBM to get new cid that have been writen success, put it into stream. If the cid haven't writen success, the cid will be put a waiting buffer. The buffer is a first-in first-out circular cache and read it regularly.

3. Updated HBM: Scan stream to get new cid and write back to HBM.

Interface
=========
The input should be a categorized graph's table by clustering algorithm such as louvain.

The result is a renumbered table which shows the number of vertices. The order of the result is the same as the order of input pairs.
