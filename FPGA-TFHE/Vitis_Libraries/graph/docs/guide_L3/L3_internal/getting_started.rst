********************************
Getting Started
********************************

In order to use Graph L3, the sofware and hardware requirements should be met and the shared library (**libgraphL3.so**) should be built and linked in the users application.  

Software Requirements
#####################
* CentOS/RHEL 7.8 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* `Xilinx RunTime (XRT) <https://github.com/Xilinx/XRT>`_ 2021.2
* `Xilinx FPGA Resource Manager (XRM) <https://github.com/Xilinx/XRM>`_ 2021.2


Hardware Requirements
#####################
* `Alveo U50 <https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u50.html>`_
* `Alveo U55C <https://www.xilinx.com/applications/data-center/high-performance-computing/u55c.html>`_


Environment Setup
#################
BASH version setup scripts are provided. Users should select their proper setup script depending on their shell version.

BASH:

.. code-block:: sh

	source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh
	source /opt/xilinx/xrm/setup.sh
	source /opt/xilinx/xrm/tools/start_xrmd.sh

These scripts set up the following environment variables:

* XILINX_XRT
	* This points to */opt/xilinx/xrt/*

* XILINX_XRM
	* This points to */opt/xilinx/xrm/*


Building the dynamic library
############################

In order to build **libgraphL3.so**, please follow the following steps:

.. code-block:: sh

   cd xf_graph/L3/lib
   ./build_so.sh
   cd xf_graph/L3/tests
   ./pre_launch.sh
  
After the build is complete, **libgraphL3.so** should be available in *Vitis_Libraries/graph/L3/lib*
