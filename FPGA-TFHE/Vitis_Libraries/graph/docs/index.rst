Vitis Graph Library
==========================

Vitis Graph Library is an open-sourced Vitis library written in C++ for accelerating graph applications in a variety of use cases. It now covers a level of acceleration: the pre-defined kernel level (L2), and will evolve to offer the module level (L1) and the software API level (L3).

Currently, this includes the following algorithm implementation:

 - Similarity analysis: Cosine Similarity, Jaccard Similarity, k-nearest neighbor. From 2021.2, the 'weight' feature is supported for Cosin Similarity. 
 - Centrality analysis: PageRank.
 - Pathfinding: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST, 2021.2), Estimated Diameter (2021.2), Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) and Multi-Sources Shortest Path (MSSP).
 - Connectivity analysis: Weekly Connected Components and Strongly Connected Components.
 - Community Detection: Louvain Modularity, Label Propagation and Triangle Count.
 - Search: Breadth First Search, 2-Hop Search 
 - Graph Format: Renumber(2021.2), Calculate Degree and Format Convert between CSR and CSC.


Shell Environment
------------------

Setup the build environment using the Vitis and XRT scripts.

.. ref-code-block:: bash
	:class: overview-code-block

        source <install path>/Vitis/2021.2/settings64.sh
        source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh
        export PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS=/opt/xilinx/platforms

Setting ``PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS`` to the installation folder of platform files can enable makefiles
in this library to use ``DEVICE`` variable as a pattern.
Otherwise, full path to .xpfm file needs to be provided via ``DEVICE`` variable.
