**********************
TigerGraph Integration
**********************

TigerGraph is a complete, distributed, parallel graph computing platform supporting web-scale data analytics in real-time. GSQL is a language designed for TigerGraph Inc.'s property graph database. Users can define their own expression functions in C++ and add them into GSQL. Graph L3 APIs can be easily integrated with TigerGraph.

Software Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* `Xilinx RunTime (XRT) <https://github.com/Xilinx/XRT>`_ 2021.2
* `Xilinx FPGA Resource Manager (XRM) <https://github.com/Xilinx/XRM>`_ 2021.2

TigerGraph integration needs static boost version XRT. Please follow the steps:

* Download `Xilinx RunTime (XRT) <https://github.com/Xilinx/XRT>`_ release version source code 
* sudo apt install libboost-program-options-dev
* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt install libcurl4-gnutls-dev
* sudo apt-get update
* source PATH_XRT/src/runtime_src/tools/scripts/xrtdeps.sh
* mkdir PATH_XRT/boost
* source PATH_XRT/src/runtime_src/tools/scripts/boost.sh -prefix PATH_XRT/boost
* source PATH_XRT/build/build.sh -clean
* sudo apt intall cmake
* sudo apt-get update
* env XRT_BOOST_INSTALL=PATH_XRT/boost/xrt PATH_XRT/build/build.sh
* cd PATH_XRT/build/Debug and PATH_XRT/build/Release
* make packages

Hardware Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* `Alveo U50 <https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u50.html>`_

Integration Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to simplify the integration of graph L3 and TigerGraph, a shell script is written. Please follow the following steps: 

* Download `TigerGraph <https://www.tigergraph.com/>`_ 2.4.0
* Install TigerGraph
* cd PATH_GRAPH_LIB/plugin
* Change `TigerGraphPath` in install.sh, Makefile and tigergraph/MakeUdf to the path of TigerGraph installed
* Change TigerGraph path related parameters in tigergraph/bash_tigergraph
* ./install.sh

Running Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the Graph library, some L3 APIs have been integrated to TigerGraph and the corresponding gsql testcases are offered. Once Users finish integration flow, they can `source run.sh` in each testcase and run the corresponding TigerGraph API.
