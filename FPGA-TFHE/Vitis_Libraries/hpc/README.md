# Vitis HPC Library 

Vitis HPC Library provides an acceleration libray for applications with high
computation workload,
e.g.  seismic imaging and inversion, high-precision simulations, genomics and etc.

## Overview

The algorithms implemented by Vitis HPC Library include:

- Multi-Layer Percepton (MLP): 

- 2D Reverse Time Migration (RTM):

- 3D RTM:

- Conjugate Gradient Solvers (CG): 


## Requirements

### FPGA Accelerator Card

Modules and APIs in this library work with Alveo U280 or U250 or U200 or U50.

* [Alveo U280](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u280.html)
* [Alveo U50](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u50.html)
* [Alveo U250](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u250.html)
* [Alveo U200](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u200.html)

### Software Platform

Supported operating systems are RHEL/CentOS 7.4, 7.5 and Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS, 18.04.1 LTS.

_GCC 5.0 or above_ is required for C++11/C++14 support.
With CentOS/RHEL 7.4 and 7.5, C++11/C++14 should be enabled via
[devtoolset-6](https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/devtoolset-6/).

### Development Tools

This library is designed to work with Vitis 2021.2,
and a matching version of XRT should be installed.

## Running Test Cases

This library ships two types of case: HLS cases and Vitis cases.
HLS cases can only be found in `L1/tests` folder, and are created to test module-level functionality.

### Setup environment

Setup and build envrionment using the Vitis and XRT scripts:

```
    source <install path>/Vitis/2021.2/settings64.sh
    source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh
```

### HLS Cases Command Line Flow

```console
cd L1/tests/hls_case_folder
make run CSIM=1 CSYNTH=1 COSIM=1 DEVICE=<FPGA platform> PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS=<path to platform directories>
```

Test control variables are:

- `CSIM` for high level simulation.
- `CSYNTH` for high level synthesis to RTL.
- `COSIM` for co-simulation between software test bench and generated RTL.

### Vitis Cases Command Line Flow

#### L2

```console
cd L2/tests/vitis_case_folder

make run TARGET=<sw_emu/hw_emu/hw> DEVICE=<FPGA platform> PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS=<path to platform directories>

# delete generated files
make cleanall
```

#### L3

```console
cd L3/tests/vitis_case_folder

make run TARGET=<hw_emu/hw> DEVICE=<FPGA platform> PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS=<path to platform directories>

# delete generated files
make cleanall
```

Here, `TARGET` decides the FPGA binary type

- `sw_emu` is for software emulation
- `hw_emu` is for hardware emulation
- `hw` is for deployment on physical card. (Compilation to hardware binary often takes hours.)

Besides ``run``, the Vitis case makefile also allows ``host`` and ``xclbin`` as build target.

## Benchmark Result

In `L2/benchmarks`, these Kernels are built into xclbins targeting Alveo U250, U280 or U50. We achieved a good performance against several problem sizes. For more details about the benchmarks, please kindly find them in [benchmark results](https://xilinx.github.io/Vitis_Libraries/hpc/2021.2/benchmark.html).
