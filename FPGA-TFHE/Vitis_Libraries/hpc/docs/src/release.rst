2020.1
----

Vitis HPC Libraray release 2020.1 introduces HLS primitives, pre-built kernles and software APIs for several HPC applications on FPGAs. These applications are: 

* 2D Acoustic RTM (Reverse Time Migration) based on FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain) algorithm, including forward kernel and backward kernel

* MLP (Mult-Layer Perceptron) and its components including common activation functions and fully connected network kernels 

2021.1

Vitis HPC Libraray 2021.2 release introduces HLS primitives, prebuild kernles and software APIs for HPC applications on FPGAs. These applications are: 

* 2D Acoustic RTM (Reverse Time Migration) based on FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain) algorithm, including forward kernel and backward kernel

* 3D Acoustic RTM based on FDTD algorithm, including forward kernel

* MLP (Mult-Layer Perceptron) and its components including common activation functions and fully connected network kernels 

* PCG (Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient) solvers for both dense and sparse matrix
