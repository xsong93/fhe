Requirements
------------

Software Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This library is designed to work with Vitis 2021.1, and therefore inherits the system requirements of Vitis and XRT.

Supported operating systems are RHEL/CentOS 7.4, 7.5 and Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS, 18.04.1 LTS.
With CentOS/RHEL 7.4 and 7.5, C++11/C++14 should be enabled via
`devtoolset-6 <https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/devtoolset-6/>`_.

PCIE Accelerator Card
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hardware modules and kernels are designed to work with Xilinx Alveo cards. Requirements for specific engines or demonstrations will be documented in the associated subdirectory. Hardware builds for Alveo board targets require package installs as:
* `Alveo U200 <https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u200.html#gettingStarted>`_
* `Alveo U250 <https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u250.html#gettingStarted>`_
