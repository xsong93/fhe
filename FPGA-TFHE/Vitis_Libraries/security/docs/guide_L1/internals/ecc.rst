ECC(Elliptic-curve Cryptography) is a public-key cryptosystem. Its encryption key is public and different from decryption key. ECC allows smaller keys compared to non-EC cryptography to provide equivalent security.
ECC cryptosystem includes key generation, key distribution, encryption/decryption and padding schemes. In this release we provide the encryption/decryption part.
Current implementation is a templated design which could adapt to various curve parameters.
