*******************************************************
Symmetric Matrix Inverse (POMATRIXINVERSE)
*******************************************************

This function computes the inverse matrix of :math:`A`

.. math::
        {A}^{-1}

where :math:`A` is a dense symmetric positive-definite matrix of size :math:`m \times m`.
The maximum matrix size supported in FPGA is templated by NMAX.
