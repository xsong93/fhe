**********************
Vitis Solver Library
**********************

Vitis Solver Library provides a collection of matrix decomposition operations, linear solvers and eigenvalue solvers.

Currently this includes the following operations for dense matrix

* Matrix decomposition

  * Cholesky decomposition for symmetric positive definite matrix
  * LU decomposition without pivoting and with partial pivoting
  * QR decomposition for general matrix
  * SVD decomposition (single value decomposition) for symmetric matrix and non-symmetric matrix (Jacobi method)

* Linear solver

  * Tridiagonal linear solver (Parallel cyclic reduction method)
  * Linear solver for triangular matrix
  * Linear solver for symmetric and non-symmetric matrix
  * Matrix inverse for symmetric and non-symmetric matrix

* Eigenvalue solver

  * Jacobi eigenvalue solver for symmetric matrix
