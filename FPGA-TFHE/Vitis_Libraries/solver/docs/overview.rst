Library Overview
=================

Vitis Solver Library provides a collection of matrix decomposition operations, linear solvers and eigenvalue solvers.
 
Currently this includes the following operations for dense matrix
 
* Matrix decomposition
   * Cholesky decomposition for symmetric positive definite matrix
   * LU decomposition without pivoting and with partial pivoting
   * QR decomposition for general matrix
   * SVD decomposition (single value decomposition) for symmetric matrix and non-symmetric matrix (Jacobi method)
 
* Linear solver
   * Tridiagonal linear solver (Parallel cyclic reduction method)
   * Linear solver for triangular matrix
   * Linear solver for symmetric and non-symmetric matrix
   * Matrix inverse for symmetric and non-symmetric matrix
 
* Eigenvalue solver
   * Jacobi eigenvalue solver for symmetric matrix
