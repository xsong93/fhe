# Vitis SPARSE Library

Vitis SPARSE Library accelerates basic linear algebra functions for handling sparse matrices.

Vitis SPARSE Library is an open-sourced Vitis library written in C++ and released under
[Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
for accelerating sparse linear algebra functions in a variety of use cases.

The main target audience of this library is users who want to accelerate
sparse matrix vector multiplication (SpMV) with FPGA cards.
Currently, this library offers two levels of acceleration:

* At module level is for the C++ implementation of basic components used in SpMV functions. These implementations are intended to be used by HLS (High Level Synthesis) users to build FPGA logic for their applications. 
* The kernel level is for pre-defined kernels that are the C++ implementation of SpMV functions. These implementations are intended to demonstrate how FPGA kernels are defined and how L1 primitive functions can be used by any Vitis users to build their kernels for their applications.

## Requirements

### FPGA Accelerator Card

Modules and APIs in this library work with Alveo U280 card.

* [Alveo U280](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u280.html)

### Software Platform

Supported operating systems are RHEL/CentOS 7.4, 7.5 and Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS, 18.04.1 LTS.

_GCC 5.0 or above_ is required for C++11/C++14 support.
With CentOS/RHEL 7.4 and 7.5, C++11/C++14 should be enabled via
[devtoolset-6](https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/devtoolset-6/).

### Development Tools

This library is designed to work with Vitis 2021.1,
and a matching version of XRT should be installed.

## Benchmark Result

In `L2/benchmarks`, more details about the benchmarks, please kindly find them in [benchmark results](https://xilinx.github.io/Vitis_Libraries/sparse/2021.1/benchmark/spmv_double.html).
