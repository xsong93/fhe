Design Flows
------------

The common tool and library pre-requisites that apply across all design flows are documented
in the requirements section above.

Recommended design flows are described as follows:

Shell Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setup the build environment using the Vitis and XRT scripts.

.. code-block:: shell

    source /opt/xilinx/Vitis/2021.2/settings64.sh
    source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh
    export PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS=/opt/xilinx/platforms


For ``csh`` users, please look for corresponding scripts with ``.csh`` suffix and adjust the variable setting command
accordingly.

Setting `PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS` to the installation folder of platform files can enable makefiles
in this library to use `DEVICE` variable as a pattern.
Otherwise, full path to .xpfm file needs to be provided via `DEVICE` variable.

HLS Cases Command Line Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: shell

    cd L1/tests/hls_case_folder
    
    make run CSIM=1 CSYNTH=0 COSIM=0 VIVADO_SYN=0 VIVADO_IMPL=0 \
        DEVICE=/path/to/xilinx_u280_xdma_201920_3.xpfm

Test control variables are:

* ``CSIM`` for high level simulation.
* ``CSYNTH`` for high level synthesis to RTL.
* ``COSIM`` for co-simulation between software test bench and generated RTL.
* ``VIVADO_SYN`` for synthesis by Vivado.
* ``VIVADO_IMPL`` for implementation by Vivado.

For all these variables, setting to ``1`` indicates execution while ``0`` for skipping.
The default value of all these control variables are ``0``, so they can be omitted from command line
if the corresponding step is not wanted.
