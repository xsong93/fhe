## Steps to run AIE testcases in Vitis GUI

The following steps need to be followed to run all Vitis Vision AIE testcases (except AIE-PL cases) in Vitis GUI. These are to performed only after all the prerequisites mentioned in top-level [README](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Libraries/blob/master/vision/README.md#prerequisites) are met.

1. Open a bash terminal
2. *cd* to any testcase under *L2/tests/aie/< function-name>/* 
3. Setup the environment using below commands:
	* *source < path-to-Vitis-installation-directory >/settings64.sh*
		- Vitisâ„¢ 2021.2 or later version supported.
	* *export DEVICE=< path-to-vck190 platform-directory >/< vck190 platform >.xpfm*
	* *source < path-to-XRT-installation-directory >/setup.sh*
	* *export SYSROOT=< path-to-versal-platform-sysroot >*
	* *export EDGE_COMMON_SW=< path-to-versal-rootfs-and-Image-files >*
4. Open *description.json* file present in the same directory and change value of attribute "gui" to *true*.
5. Open Vitis GUI from the same terminal using the command *vitis* and create application project for that aie function.
	* Add platform and related details:
		- Add platform to repository: < path-to-vck190 platform-directory >/< vck190 platform >.xpfm
		- Sysroot path: < path-to-versal-platform-sysroot >
		- Root FS: < path-to-versal-platform-rootfs >
		- Kernel Image:  < path-to-versal-platform-kernel-Image >

6. After project creation, open *host.cpp* from GUI ProjName[xrt] -> src folder. If *host.cpp* has *#include "graph.cpp"* then replace *graph.cpp* with its absolute path i.e. the absolute path for *graph.cpp* present in GUI ProjName_aie[aiengine] -> src folder. To get absolute path, right click on *graph.cpp* and select Properties. Under Properties, location gives its absolute path.
7. Right click on ProjName[xrt] and select *C/C++ Build Settings -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings -> GCC Host Linker -> Libraries -> Library search path*
8. Under *Library search path* section, add *${workspace_loc:${ProjName}/libs/xf_opencv/L1/lib/sw/aarch64-linux/}*
9. Open a new bash terminal, *cd* to the same testcase directory and repeat step 3
10. Run the command : *make x86sim TARGET=hw_emu HOST_ARCH=aarch64* (ignore simulation failures)

	This command generates *aie_control_xrt.cpp* that is needed to build AIE GUI project, at < current-directory>/Work/ps/c_rts/
11. Copy *aie_control_xrt.cpp* generated in above step and paste it in the GUI project folder where *host.cpp* is present.
12. Go to GUI project
	* Build Emulation-HW
	* Run hwemu-launch
